# PongGame
Ping Pong Game played against the computer. Implemented in C and uses an ATMEGA-1284p microcontroller.

The system recognizes when the ball contacts the center of any paddle, slowing down the ball, or the corner of any paddle, speeding up the ball in a diagonal direction. 
If the player scores on the computer, a "W" is displayed, otherwise an "L" is displayed if the player is scored on.
