# PongGame
### Ping Pong Game played against the computer. Implemented in C and uses an ATMEGA-1284p microcontroller.

- The game is displayed on a LED Matrix and takes in user input from 3 switches. The top switch resets the game, second moves the players paddle  up, and the third makes the paddle move down. 
- The system recognizes when the ball contacts the center of any paddle, slowing down the ball, or the corner of any paddle, speeding up the ball in a diagonal direction. 
- If the player scores on the computer, a "W" is displayed, otherwise an "L" is displayed if the player is scored on.
